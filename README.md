Calculating GHG Emissions From Electricity Consumption

The notebook uses US EPA eGRID 2021 emission factors to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity consumed. The emissions are calculated for each gas (e.g., CO2, CH4) and also calculated based on the zip code where the electricity is consumed. The user will be prompted to enter their five digit zip code and amount of electricity consumed and this notebook will calculate their scope 2 and 3 emissions for each gas.

I used Kaggle with Python (pandas and tabulate). The Kaggle notebook can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/elizabethtutino/electricity-ghg-emissions

I also included an Example Output png file to demonstrate what the results would look like after the user entered their zip code and amount of electricity consumed.
